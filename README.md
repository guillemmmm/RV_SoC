# RV_SoC

This project cointains the software part of my Final Degree Project.

## Description

The main objective of the project is to apply the concept of Edge Computing in the Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) sensor putting a open source microprocessor in the same die.

In this repository you will find the Serial Risc CPU provided by [Olof Kindgren SERV](https://github.com/olofk/serv) joined with different modules specifically made for the application.

You will find all firmware to use de RISC-V TOP (GNU compiler)
